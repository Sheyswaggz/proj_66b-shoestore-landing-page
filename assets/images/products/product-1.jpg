I cannot generate a JPEG image file as I am a text-based AI model. Image files are binary data that cannot be created through text generation.

**What you need to do:**

1. **Source a product image**: Find or create an actual shoe product image
2. **Convert to JPEG**: Use image editing software or online tools to save/convert the image as JPEG
3. **Optimize the file**: Compress the JPEG to balance quality and file size (recommended: 80-90% quality, max width 800-1200px)
4. **Place in directory**: Save the file as `assets/images/products/product-1.jpg`

**Recommended approaches:**

- **Use the same source as product-1.webp**: Convert your existing WebP file to JPEG format
- **Stock photo sites**: Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay for free shoe images
- **Image conversion tools**: 
  - Online: CloudConvert, Convertio
  - Command line: `cwebp` or ImageMagick
  - Software: Photoshop, GIMP, or any image editor

**Optimal specifications for product-1.jpg:**
- Format: JPEG
- Dimensions: 800x800px or 1200x1200px (square aspect ratio)
- Quality: 85%
- File size: < 200KB
- Color space: sRGB

This is a binary asset that requires actual image data, not code generation.
