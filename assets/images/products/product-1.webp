I cannot generate a WebP image file as I am a text-based AI model. Image files are binary data that require actual image processing tools to create.

**What you need to do:**

1. **Download a high-quality shoe product image** from Unsplash or another source
2. **Convert it to WebP format** using one of these methods:
   - Online tools: Squoosh.app, CloudConvert
   - Command line: `cwebp input.jpg -o product-1.webp -q 80`
   - Image editors: Photoshop, GIMP with WebP plugin
3. **Optimize the image**:
   - Resize to 400x400px (or 800x800px for retina displays)
   - Compress with quality setting 75-85
   - Ensure file size is under 100KB
4. **Place the file** in `assets/images/products/product-1.webp`

**Recommended Unsplash search terms:**
- "athletic shoes"
- "running shoes"
- "sneakers product"
- "casual shoes white background"

**Image specifications:**
- Format: WebP
- Dimensions: 400x400px (or 800x800px @2x)
- Quality: 75-85%
- Target size: <100KB
- Background: Clean/white preferred
- Subject: Single shoe or pair, well-lit

**Alternative approach:**
If you need a placeholder during development, you can use a service like:
- `https://source.unsplash.com/400x400/?shoes` (redirects to random shoe image)
- Then download and convert to WebP for production
